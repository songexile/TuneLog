# TuneLog 

- TuneLog is an app created in React Native. It allows users to sign up with their email and password to create an account.
- The app uses the Spotify API and retrieves the users OAuth 2.0 token to retrieve and display Spotify statistics, such as Top Songs, Top Artists, etc.
- You can follow other users to keep up to date with their music and things they have personalised on their profile!
