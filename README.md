# TuneLog 




TuneLog is an app created with React Native. It allows users to sign up with their email and password to create an account.
The app uses the Spotify API and retrieves the users OAuth 2.0 token to display Spotify statistics, such as Top Songs, Top Artists, etc.
You can follow other users to keep up to date with their music such what
- What they are currently listening to.
- View their personalized profile
- View their top songs.
- View their top artists.

TuneLog is for music enthusiast that want to keep up to date with what their friends are listening to and to view their stats or even their own.

## Warning - This application requires a Spotify account as it heavily depends on the Spotify API for full useage. Without a Spotify account you can't access the app.

## Installation
Recommended to use Visual Studio Code 1.70.2 and `powershell terminal` for running commands.
In order to set up the app and install all dependencies, clone the repository and run:
 ```bash
 yarn install
 ```

You can then start the app by running:
```bash
 yarn start
 ```

From here, simply follow the expo instructions in the CLI in order to run the project in an IOS/Android environment. You will also have to download the ExpoGo app on your device, the QR code is used, it will prompt you to download this app.
**Please note, if you open the app using the QR code on another device, you must be on the same local area network as the machine running the app.**

You will also need to configure Spotify clientId, clientSecret and redirectUri
These can be found on the **ConnectSpotifyScreen.js**

Head to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard and make a account. This will grant you a clientId & clientSecret key.
The redirectUri should be set to the address that yarn start gives you.
